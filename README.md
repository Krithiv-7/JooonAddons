# **‚ùìSome Frequently asked questions and answers:**

- Q: Is there a video preview?
> A: Yes!, there is the latest preview showcasing the entirety of Jooon Addons, as well as 2 others that has similar functionality to JooonAddons, specifically the Melody video showcasing all songs.
[JooonAddons Official Release (CLICK ME!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYqCntvSDas),
[Dojo (CLICK ME!)](https://youtu.be/FmI1B04Hnfs),
[Melody (CLICK ME!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z75T1vFggbU)

- Q: Is this mod Safe to use?
> A: Yes! This mod is entirely safe to use as it follows Hypixel's guidelines and only does actions the exact same way a regular human would.

- Q: Can I use this on any computer/account/network?
> A: Yes! This mod is not license based as it is entirely free to use, so you can use this on any Windows, MacOS, Linux, Ethernet/WiFi and Minecraft account as you wish.

- Q: What ping is this for?
> A: Any ping! If you have low ping but are simply struggling with the dojo or the harp you can use this mod as well!

- Q: What's the maximum amount of points I can get in the Dojo?
> A: As much as you'd like! You control when the mod stops, so point gain can be infinite!

- Q: Can I get black belt and the combat experience with this? And can I get the Tuning Fork/Melody's Hair accessory too?
> A: Yes! You can use this to safely get all 7000 points required for the black belt, you can also easily use this to get both the Melody's hair accessory and the Tuning Fork!

- Q: Do you plan to support later versions of Minecraft, like 1.20?
> A: Not currently, as the base of the mod is locked to 1.8.9, moving all of the features while retaining functionality would be difficult but not impossible, stay tuned.

- Q: How do I apply for Beta/Alpha tests?
> A: Currently these roles are filled and I'm not taking any new applicants, thank you for your interest!
